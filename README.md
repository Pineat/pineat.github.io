This app automatically classify photos in your device using location, food, people,,, etc. 
Don't worry! All photo data is identical in your album, and your photos are not uploaded anywhere!
But universally synced across all your devices via iCloud! :D

How about looking back on your memories with colorful pins and fabulous dark mode?
You can make an album right away from the photos included in the organized places, or even delete them all at once!
